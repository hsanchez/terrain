\subsection{Terrain Generation Algorithms}
Terrain generation is essentially to generate a height for each point in 2D space. It can be seen as using a function to map \textit{x} and \textit{y} coordinates into \textit{z} coordinates: \[z=terrainGen(x, y)\]

In this project, we implemented three terrain generation algorithms, namely, Perlin Noise, Simplex Noise and Diamond Square. This section gives an overview of the three algorithms.

\subsubsection{Perlin Noise}
Perlin noise is procedurally generated noise proposed by Ken Perlin \cite{Perlin2002}. In 2D space, Perlin noise works as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create a grid of vectors, whose \textit{x} and \textit{y} coordinates are all integers. Every point in the 2D space falls into a square in the grid, where four vertexes of the square can be decided by taking the floors and ceilings of its \textit{x} and \textit{y} coordinates. 
\end{enumerate}
