\subsection{Demonstration}
In this section, we will present the interface of the terrain generation, with all the features described in previous sections. The system has only one web page as interface. The middle of it shows the first-person view of the terrain. Below the terrain is a simple help for users to control the view. Users could move forward/backward/right/left using the arrow keys, or press 'g' to regenerate another terrain. In addition, users could toggle day or night view by pressing 'n' key. Figure~\ref{fig:demo_0_1} was generated using Perlin noise and covered by grass texture, where we can see the surface of the terrain is very smooth, with high maintains. Figure~\ref{fig:demo_1_1}, \ref{fig:demo_1_2} and \ref{fig:demo_1_3} were generated by diamond-square, although there are covered by different textures. These terrains are not as smooth as the one generated by Perlin noise, and they a mostly rolling hills. Figure~\ref{fig:demo_2_1} was generated by combining Perlin noise and diamond-square, which combines the terrain features of the two: high mountains with rough surface. Finally, simplex noise generates sharp mountains as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:demo_3_0}, \ref{fig:demo_3_2} and \ref{fig:demo_3_3}.
