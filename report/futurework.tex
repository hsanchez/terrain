\section{Future Work} 
\label{sec:future_work}
As mentioned in the Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, the generated terrains are intended to be used to test-drive the generated robots. Future work of this terrain generator would be directly related to the robot design generator. We first need to incorporate the terrain generation API into the robot generator, so that terrains can be generated in the latter system as needed. Then a physics engine in JavaScript is needed in order to simulate the gravity and detect collision, i.e. to guarantee that vehicles run on the surface of the terrain but not go into it or float on the sky. Last but not least, control logic needs to be adapted, so that the camera can follow the vehicle under test, and it is no longer first-person view as in this project.
