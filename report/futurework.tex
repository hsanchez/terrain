\section{Future Work} 
\label{sec:future_work}

As mentioned in the Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, the generated terrains are intended to be used by our Robot Design Generator tool to test-drive generated robot designs. As part of the future work of our terrain generator, we have: First, we need to incorporate the terrain generation API into our Robot Design Generator tool, so that we could generate different terrains at will. Second, a JavaScript physics engine must be integrated into our Robot Design Generator tool in order to simulate gravity and collision detection, i.e., to guarantee that our generated robot designs run on the surface of a given terrain, but not to go into it or float on the sky. Finally, some control logic needs to be implemented in our Terrain Generation API, so that we have the option of either having the camera follow the generated robot design under test, or using the already available first-person view control.
