\subsection{Problem Description}
In this project, we want to produce 3D terrain on web browsers. The system needs to provide a first-person experience for users to walk on or fly over different terrain styles, which are generated randomly, with different shapes and textures. The terrain generation should not require users to install additional browser plugins and the generation calculation is done in browsers. The systems should respond to users navigation operations (mouse dragging, key pressing) quickly.
